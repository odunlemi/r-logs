    <p>R-logs, also round logs, which are to document multiple rounds a #100daysofcode challenge. You can read more about it <a href="">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>R1D1 - Sep. 8, 2025</h2>
    <p>Block and inline elements. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line. An example is the h1 - h6 tags and the paragraph tag p. Inline elements do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. Examples being the anchor tag a, and span, which is used to group text to be styled. The middle ground is the inline-block, which formats an element to be inline but take the characteristics of a block level element. More in the <a href="./resources.md">resources</a> tab. Completed an assignment, documented here on the <a href="https://github.com/odunlemi/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/block-and-inline">repo</a>.</p>
