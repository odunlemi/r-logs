            <p>R-logs, also round logs, which are to document multiple rounds of the #100daysofcode challenge. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code?tab=readme-ov-file#if-youve-decided-to-join">here</a>.</p>

            <p>This is Round 1, R-1, of my challenge. The goal is to nail the basics of web development by learning the technologies of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and becoming proficient in prototyping webpages and the basics of JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Block and inline elements. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line. An example is the h1 - h6 tags and the paragraph tag p. Inline elements do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. Examples being the anchor tag a, and span, which is used to group text to be styled. The middle ground is the inline-block, which formats an element to be inline but take the characteristics of a block level element. More in the <a href="./linked-resources.html">resources</a> tab. Completed an assignment, documented here on the <a href="https://github.com/odunlemi/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/block-and-inline">repo</a>.</p>

            <p>Flexbox provides a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex, grow, or shrink based on defined rules. Flexbox is just not a single css property, it's a toolbox of properties to arrange things where you need them. Elements can either become a flex container or a flex item. An element becomes a flex container with its display set to flex like so display: flex, and a an element is a flex item when it is nested in a flex container.

            <h2>R1D3 - Sep. 10, 2025</h2>

            <p>Floats were the sole option of laying out a complex webpage. However, floats were originally designed for magazine-style layouts, and the kinds of layouts you can achieve with floats are somewhat limited. Flexbox was created to break out of the limitations. Flexbox gives complete control over the alignment, direction, order, size of the elements (boxes) in our layout.

            <h2>R1D4 - Sep. 11, 2025</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight">flex: [value]</span>. The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. In this case, <span class="highlight">flex</span> is actually a shorthand for <span class="highlight">flex-grow</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink</span> and <span class="highlight">flex-basis</span>.</p>

            <p>With a value of 1, as commonly used, <span class="highlight">flex: 1</span> equates to: <span class="highlight">flex-grow: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-basis: 0</span>.</p>

            <p>When <span class="highlight">auto</span> is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of <span class="highlight">flex-grow: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink: 1</span> and <span class="highlight">flex-basis: auto</span> or to <span class="highlight">flex: 1 1 auto</span> using the flex shorthand. Note that <span class="highlight">flex: auto</span> is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto”.</p>
