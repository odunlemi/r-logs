Block and inline elements. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line. An example is the h1 - h6 tags and the paragraph tag, p.

Inline elements do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. Examples being the anchor tag, a, and span, which is used to group text to be applied styles.

The middle ground is the *inline-block*, which formats an element to be inline but take the characteristics of a block level element.

Completed an assignment, hosted [here](https://github.com/odunlemi/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/block-and-inline), and rebuilt an earlier recipes website with the css I've picked up so far - https://odunlemi.github.io/odin-recipes/
