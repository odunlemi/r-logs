            <p>R-logs, also round logs, which are to document multiple rounds of the #100daysofcode challenge. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code?tab=readme-ov-file#if-youve-decided-to-join">here</a>.</p>

            <p>This is Round 1, R-1, of my challenge. The goal is to nail the basics of web development by learning the technologies of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and becoming proficient in prototyping webpages and the basics of JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Block and inline elements. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line. An example is the h1 - h6 tags and the paragraph tag p. Inline elements do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. Examples being the anchor tag a, and span, which is used to group text to be styled. The middle ground is the inline-block, which formats an element to be inline but take the characteristics of a block level element. More in the <a href="./linked-resources.html">resources</a> tab. Completed an assignment, documented here on the <a href="https://github.com/odunlemi/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/block-and-inline">repo</a>.</p>

            <p>Flexbox provides a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex, grow, or shrink based on defined rules. Flexbox is just not a single css property, it's a toolbox of properties to arrange things where you need them. Elements can either become a flex container or a flex item. An element becomes a flex container with its display set to flex like so display: flex, and a an element is a flex item when it is nested in a flex container.

            <h2>R1D3 - Sep. 10, 2025</h2>

            <p>Floats were the sole option of laying out a complex webpage. However, floats were originally designed for magazine-style layouts, and the kinds of layouts you can achieve with floats are somewhat limited. Flexbox was created to break out of the limitations. Flexbox gives complete control over the alignment, direction, order, size of the elements (boxes) in our layout.

            <h2>R1D4 - Sep. 11, 2025</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight">flex: [value]</span>. The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. In this case, <span class="highlight">flex</span> is actually a shorthand for <span class="highlight">flex-grow</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink</span> and <span class="highlight">flex-basis</span>.</p>

            <p>With a value of 1, as commonly used, <span class="highlight">flex: 1</span> equates to: <span class="highlight">flex-grow: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-basis: 0</span>.</p>

            <p>When <span class="highlight">auto</span> is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of <span class="highlight">flex-grow: 1</span>, <span class="highlight">flex-shrink: 1</span> and <span class="highlight">flex-basis: auto</span> or to <span class="highlight">flex: 1 1 auto</span> using the flex shorthand. Note that <span class="highlight">flex: auto</span> is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto”.</p>

            <p>Axes in flexbox. When an element is made a flex container, its items align across two axes - the main axis and the cross axis. <span class="highlight">justify-content</span> aligns items across the main axis. To change the placement of items along the cross axis use <span class="highlight">align-items</span>. The main axis and cross axis are based on the <span class="highlight">flex-direction</span> of the container, if <span class="highlight">row</span> which is the default, the main axis goes from left to right (horizonatal) and the cross axis goes from top to bottom (vertical).</p>

            <p>Flex direction set to <span class="highlight">column</span> switches those axes and <span class="highlight">justify-content</span> then aligns items vertically and, <span class="highlight">align-items</span>, horizontally.</p>

            <h2>R1D6 - Sep. 13, 2025</h2>

            <p>Flexbox is one of the many different layout algorithms, officially known as layout modes, in CSS.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Each layout mode is its own sub-language within CSS. The default layout mode is the Flow layout but we can opt into flexbox by changing the display property on the parent container.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight">When we flip display to flex, we create a “flex formatting context”. This means that, by default, all children will be positioned according to the Flexbox layout algorithm.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Each layout algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem. The default “Flow” layout is meant to create digital documents; it's essentially the Microsoft Word layout algorithm. Headings and paragraphs stack vertically as blocks, while things like text, links, and images sit inconspicuously within these blocks.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight">So, what problem does Flexbox solve? Flexbox is all about arranging a group of items in a row or column, and giving us a ridiculous amount of control over the distribution and alignment of those items. As the name suggests, Flexbox is all about flexibility. We can control whether items grow or shrink, how the extra space is distributed, and more.</span></p>

            <p>This is the basic mental model for understanding flexbox, picked up in Josh W. Comeau's guide along with tons of examples.</p>

            <h2>R1D7 - Sep. 15, 2025</h2>

            <p>Skipped yesterday (Sep. 14) but in keeping in line with the rules and <a href="https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/FAQ.md">good practice</a>, I can miss a day but I'll make up for it with an added day at the end of the challenge. I absolutely cannot miss two days in a row though.</p>

            <p>Learning the flexbox algorithm has been daunting, it <span class="highlight">is</span> complex, but obviously a very powerful layout mode.</p>

            <p>I could list out all I've learnt but that would be pretty redundant (because it spanned days). The most important takeaway is the mental model highlighted in R1D5, flexbox is an algorithm and the properties we define act as inputs to it on how it defines and implements them.</p>

            <p>Some excellent resources to revisit for a quick primer:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An interactive guide to flexbox by Josh W. Comeau*</li>
                <li>Flexbox Froggy</li>
                <li>Look at this CSS Tricks <a href="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/css-flexbox-poster.png">cheatsheet</a> for quick reminder on flex properties.</li>

            <p>Going forward, I'll be logging more accurately, this early in my journey I'm covering a lot of material, so it'll be the key thing learnt that day and work done.</p>

            <h2>R1D8 - Sep. 16, 2025</h2>

            <p>Started on Frontend mentor challenges and coded the first one, which is a blog preview card. I had the chance to write a properly structured css file which I picked up on the tricks to from the previous tutorials and examples I've seen. Like declaring only base styles for the <span class="highlight">body</span> tag, not using it as a flex container.</p>
            
            <p>Also kicked off JavaScript. HTML and CSS add content and style, JavaScript adds interactivity. The simplest way to get started is to create an html file, add a basic structure and a <span class="highlight">script</span> tag in the body tag with a message:</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">console.log("Hello, JavaScript!")</span></p>

            <p>Opening up the webpage and inspecting it via the console (<span>F12</span> for dev tools on the browser) shows the javascript code output.</p>
